## Description
Build a Quiz of Your Choice (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery)

### Website should have:
Create a personality quiz that contains several questions that use checkboxes to select answers. Each question should instruct users to "Check all that apply".

**A Stress Test**

- Include several questions.
    - One that lists warning signs of being negatively affected by stress ("Loss of sleep", "Feeling overwhelmed", etc.)
    - One that lists health symptoms linked to high-stress ("High blood pressure", "anxiety", etc.)
    - Another that lists recommended coping methods to deal with stress. ("Meditate", "Manage your time", "Pet a cat", etc.) Instruct users to check all that apply to them.

- Then, based on user answers, provide some guidance: For instance, if a user reports 4 stress-related symptoms, and 6 warning signs apply to them, suggest some resources to help them out.

- Or, if a user says 4 warning signs of high stress apply to them, but they also report using 5 of the recommended ways to manage stress, tell them they're doing a pretty good job.

- Include at least 3 possible results.
